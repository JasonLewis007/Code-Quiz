# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task
I created a web application coding quiz that is timed.  At the end of the quiz the high scores are recorded to compare with prior quiz takers.  I have taken questions from javascript fundamentals to quiz the user.  


To start the application, the user presses the start button and the timer starts a countdown.
Once the timer starts, a question appears for the user to answer.
Once the user answers the question, they will be alerted if their answer is right/wrong
If the answer is wrong, points and 5 seconds are deducted.
The quiz is done when all questions are answered or the time has ended.
When the quiz is over, the score is shown to the user.
The user is then prompted to enter intials and will be saved for compariosn by other peers.
